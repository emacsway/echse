echse beef
==========

While [echse][1] is a tool set to merge, filter and unroll recurrence
definitions in iCalendar files the actual USP of echse lies within its
database of holidays and trading hours, the stuff that we call beef,
in contrast to [echse][1] playing the role of cutlery.

Development
-----------

The iCalendar files are managed in the [`beef` branch][2] of the
[echse repository][3].  Patches are welcome.

Seeing as the iCalendar files are largely independent, there will be no
releases.  The latest version can always be downloaded using git.
